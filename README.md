# RyanChat

This is the repository for the development version of my RyanChat app. Here you can view both the front-end and back-end portions of the app. If you would like to clone the 
repository and run it on your machine, you will need to have the following installed:

# Yarn CLI - check with yarn -v
Available here: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started

# Node.js - check with node -v
Available here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Upon cloning the repository and verifying the above two are installed, navigate to the SocketIO-Node-ChatApp/server/ directory in your shell. Run the command yarn start. 
Open a new instance of your shell and navigate to the SocketIO-Node-ChatApp/client/ directory. Again, run the command yarn start. You should now be able to navigate 
to http://localhost:3000 and view the app.
